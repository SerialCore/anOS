/*
* .globl is a directive to our assembler, that tells it to export this symbol
* to the elf file. Convention dictates that the symbol _start is used for the 
* entry point, so this all has the net effect of setting the entry point here.
* Ultimately, this is useless as the elf itself is not used in the final 
* result, and so the entry point really doesn't matter, but it aids clarity,
* allows simulators to run the elf, and also stops us getting a linker warning
* about having no entry point.
